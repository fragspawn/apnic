I've failed to get this app to deploy in docker, because of mysql

The perennial security question is how do we incorporate passwords but not expose them in an untrusted way like on GitHub.

I've tried parameter passing, so on instantiation, set your password as an argument.

This does not work well with dockerfile or docker-compose.yml

Will spend another hour or two but, going to lunch...
