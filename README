I've chosen chart.js to render data on page request. On load, the page pulls the data via an JQuery AJAX function. A web service encapsulates SQL in a PHP script. 
The deployment script uses curl to download the data, and import it into a MySQL database, using basic shell commands.

The docker has proven to be difficult, specifically because of the way docker secures MySQL at run time. A practice of putting passwords into code is frowned upon. I continue to research best practice here. so the solution is not working as at commit v3
